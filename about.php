    The ultimate goal of PHR is empower patients to take control over their 
    health by offering self-service appointment scheduling and secure, 
    on demand access to past appointment history.

    According to HealthIT.gov,
    �Much of what your patients do for their health happens outside clinical
    settings. When your patients can track their health over time and have
    information and tools to manage their health, they can be more engaged
    in their health and health care�.

    The web-based portal can be accessed from any device with a secure 
    internet connection.  Having medical information readily available 
    means that it can easily be shared with others who may need it to 
    help make important decisions. PHR will facilitate communication 
    between patients and providers which will reduce costs associated 
    with avoidable emergency visits, while improving the overall quality 
    of care and patient experience. TEST TEST
